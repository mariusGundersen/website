# MDX

Some time ago I felt an urge to write about pan-zoom components and how they can be made well. It's a type of component I like and I wanted to share the code and math that is needed to make pan and zoom behave well, both with a mouse and with touch screens. I ~~needed~~ wanted it to be an interactive article with demos and animations, but my website/blog was just a static site generated from markdown files using [gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com). I had seen the [very good article on reactjs](https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/) by Rodrigo Pombo, where he used [Gatsby-waves](https://github.com/pomber/gatsby-waves) to have code update while the user scrolled, and I wanted to do something similar, but with math equations. So I gave [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) a quick look and decided that I didn't really like it, too much GraphQL and to much magic just for a static site. But the wave stuff wasn't really using Gatsby, it was using something called [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/), which was jsx and markdown in the same file. This intrigued me, and I decided to look into having mdx support in my Gulpfile.
