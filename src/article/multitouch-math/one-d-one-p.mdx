## One dimension, one pointer

Let's start with the simplest scenario: one dimension and one pointer. That means we only need the `x` variable for positioning, and can disregard the `y` and `s` variables. We also only care about one pointer, so be careful not to touch the screen with two fingers for this example (Now that I've said it, I know you will try).

To implemend this we need to remember the definition from the previous section: Find the transformation values such that the dragpoint in the image is where the touchpoint is on the screen. So we have to do three things:

* find the dragpoint in the image
* find the touchpoint on the screen
* find the transformation so the two are at the same place



```
on touch start:
 - get the point on the screen where the touch is
 - find out where in the image this is
 - save this point in a variable

on touch move:
 - get the point on the screen where the touch is
 - recall the point in the image we saved earlier
 - solve the equation
```

- v = m + t
- numberline
- m = v - t
- on touch start
- on touch move
