\move{A-l}{A} \move{x}{x} \move{eq}{=} \move{b}{b}


$$

There is a way to solve an equation like this. Here $A$ is a matrix while $x$ and $b$ are vectors, and we want to know the values in $x$. To solve it we just take multiply by the inverse of $A$ on both sides of the equation, like this:

$$

\move{A-inv-a}{A^{-1}} \move{A-l}{A} \move{x}{x} \move{eq}{=} \move{A}{A}\move{inv-b}{^{-1}} \move{b}{b}


$$

The inverse of a matrix multiplied with itself is roughly the same as the inverse of a number multiplied with itself. That is, $5^{-1} * 5 * 7 = 1 * 7 = 1$, so $A^-1 * A * x = I * x = x$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.

$$

\move{x}{x} \move{eq}{=} \move{A}{A}\move{inv-b}{^{-1}} \move{b}{b}


$$

So we remove the $A^{-1}A$ part, since it doesn't do anything useful, and the result is this simple equation where we find $x$ by multiplying the inverse of $A$ with $b$.

But, we have a problem that makes this simple trick not work.

$$

\arc{A}{A} \move{x}{x} \move{eq}{=} \move{b}{b}


$$

We go back to where we started, $Ax=b$.

Finding the inverse assumes that $A$ is a square matrix, that it has the same number of rows and columns. But what does our $A$ look like?

$$

\move{A}{
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 2 & 3 \\
    4 & 5 & 6 \\
    7 & 8 & 9 \\
    7 & 8 & 9
  \end{bmatrix}
}

\move{x}{
  \begin{bmatrix}
    s \\
    t_x \\
    t_y
  \end{bmatrix}
}

\move{eq}{=}

\move{b}{
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 \\
    2 \\
    3 \\
    4
  \end{bmatrix}
}


$$

In our scenario we have three unknowns, the scale ($s$) and the translation ($t_x$ and $t_y$). But we have at least four equations, therefore $A$ has four rows and three columns. And there is no way to take the inverse of a 3x4 matrix!

So what can we do?

$$

\move{A}{A} \move{x}{x} \move{eq}{=} \move{b}{b}


$$

Back to this simple formula again.

Math is fun, because we can use tricks to make the impossible possible. Since we can't take the inverse of a non square matrix, we make a square one that we can inverse!

$$

\move{At-a}{A\t} \move{A}{A} \move{x}{x} \move{eq}{=} \move{At-b}{A\t} \move{b}{b}


$$

We can multiply both sides by the transpose of the $A$ matrix.

Doing the same operation on both sides is (almost) always allowed in algebra. When multiplying $A\t$ and $A$ we get a square matrix which is possible to inverse.

$$

\move{x}{x} \move{eq}{=} \fade{l-parent}{(} \move{At-a,motion=arc-inverse}{A\t} \move{A,motion=arc-inverse}{A} \fade{inv}{)^{-1}} \move{At-b}{A\t} \move{b}{b}


$$

Moving (and inverting) $A\t A$ to the other side of the equal sign gives us the equation for $x$ that we can solve.
