<p>I just received my first ever 3D printed object from <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/">Shapeways</a>, a <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/model/69177/centripetalbox.html">CentripetalBox</a>. Shapeways provide a cheap and simple way to 3D print anything you can imagine in a variety of materials, including ABS (like Lego), stainless steel and even color printed 3D objects. This is the first time I have 3D printed anything, so I was quite excited, but at the same time expecting a designflaw showing up in the finished product.</p>
<p><a class="imageLink" href="fullsize/centripetalbox1.jpg"><img src="thumbnail/centripetalbox1.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The design I got printed was a CentripetalBox, a cube which needs to be spun around quickly to be opened. You can see a video of how it works below. The original design had 4 plugs which would fit inside the 4 slots in the box and lid, but due to the inaccuracy of the printing process, the plugs where slightly too big. The lid was also a bit too big, and needed to be sanded down slightly to fit inside the box. This was expected, but what was not expected was how tough the material was. I printed in <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/materials/white_strong_flexible">White, Strong and Flexible</a>, and while the surface is quite rough and seems fragile (small particles of the raw material powder will come loose if you scratch it), the actual box is pretty solid. I tried sanding down the plugs so they would fit inside the slots, but quickly moved to a file instead. A Dremel might have been a good tool to have handy. Instead of using the printed plastic plugs I used a thin steel rod cut into plugs. It might even be that the plastic plugs are too light to work. A few more days of sanding/filing, and I&#39;ll know.</p>

<p>Having discussed the end result and design with my dad, we came up with some improvements. I&#39;ll make a new version for the <a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/gundersen">Shapeways shop</a> with those improvements (and bug fixes, like smaller plugs, and a tiny gap between the lid and the box). This is the first thing I have ever made in Blender and then 3D printed, and the fact that it works (with a bit of post-production work) is more than I expected. I have a few other ideas for 3D printing, and I&#39;ll work on them this spring (or autumn, if you are in Australia).</p>
